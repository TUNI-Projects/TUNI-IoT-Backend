# Very Smart Backend

Very Smart Backend is the intended backend for IoT Project. The Project is separated into two parts, CoapServer which is in `coap` directory and main `django` backend. We have used `sqlit3` database to manage the data, because we simply didn't want to take the pain to create a postgresql database. Check `coap` directory readme to how to run the `coap` server. 

## How to 

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required packages in the virtualenv. 
2. `python3 manage.py runserver` to run the server.
